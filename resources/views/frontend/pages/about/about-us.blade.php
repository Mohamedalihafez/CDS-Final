                                     Medicine has been around for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of
                        skill and knowledge)
                        frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For
                        example, a medicine
                        man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would
                        apply bloodletting
                        according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science,
                        most medicine
                        has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of
                        medical science).
                        While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what
                        happens at the
                        cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.

                        Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They
                        remain commonly
                        used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For
                        example, evidence
                        on the effectiveness of acupuncture is "variable and inconsistent" for any condition,[2] but is
                        generally
                        safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner. In contrast, treatments outside the
                        bounds of
                        safety and efficacy are termed quackery.
